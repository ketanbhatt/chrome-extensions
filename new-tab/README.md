## Improved "new tab" page

This is a simple chrome extension I hacked together which was inspired by an
[awesome post](http://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1po1wd/where_work_gets_done/) I saw on reddit (thanks iFargle and -Lubber-).

### Features

* Replace new tab page with "improved" version.
* Loads bookmarks from a Chrome bookmarks folder of your choosing.
* Has customizable "quick search" capabilities.
* Persistent "notepad" using Chrome's storage API.
* Quick jump to URL using mnemonics (i.e. "gi co chro" -> https://github.com/coleifer/chrome-extensions)
* Support for displaying favicons.
